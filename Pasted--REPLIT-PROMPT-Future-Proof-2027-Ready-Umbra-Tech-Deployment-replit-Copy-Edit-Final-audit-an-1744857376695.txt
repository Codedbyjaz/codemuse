Final audit and upgrade for Umbra Tech donation site and backend. Make it fully secure, scalable, bug-free, and future-proof for public launch and long-term growth.

🧩 GOAL: Build a production-grade donation platform and admin system using the latest security, UX, and API best practices. Must support global donors, Stripe-based payments, and expansion to a funder ecosystem.

---

🔐 SECURITY (Bug-Free + Hacker-Resistant):

✅ Sanitize all user input (frontend and backend)
✅ Lock all POST routes to expected input schema
✅ Use express-rate-limit to avoid abuse
✅ Add helmet for HTTP headers
✅ Validate Stripe webhook signatures (if used)
✅ Prevent Stripe amount manipulation (fixed price IDs only)
✅ Use environment variables for ALL keys and admin credentials
✅ Block access to hidden files or debug data
✅ Hide any dev tools, logs, or test elements

---

📈 DONATION SYSTEM (Live & Smart):

✅ `/create-checkout-session` route should:
- Use real price ID `price_1REfTjCp4UU2EU8IxhQZxxxl`
- Redirect to `/thank-you.html` on success
- Redirect to `/donation-failed.html` on cancel
- Log donation data (amount, UTM source, timestamp) server-side

✅ Build a dynamic donation tracker on the frontend:
- Pulls real donation total from Stripe or logs
- Visual progress bar (% to $25,000 goal)
- Auto-hides bar if $0 and displays: “Be the first to support our mission!”

---

📊 ADMIN + GROWTH SYSTEMS:

✅ Add `/admin-dashboard`:
- Password protected (from `.env` ADMIN_PASS)
- Show:
  - Total raised
  - Average donation
  - Donor history (last 10)
  - Export to CSV
- Visual donation chart (daily/weekly Stripe data)

✅ Enable full UTM tracking:
- Capture `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`
- Attach to donation logs or Stripe metadata
- Add analytics (Plausible or GA4)

---

🧱 FAILSAFES + USER EXPERIENCE:

✅ `/donation-failed.html`: friendly fallback
✅ `/thank-you.html`: warm success message, share options
✅ `/error.html`: global crash fallback
✅ Add `MAINTENANCE=true` flag in `.env` that disables donate button and shows message
✅ Hide “supporters” or “sponsors” section if no data exists

---

🎯 MARKETING + SCALING:

✅ Add SEO tags and meta data:
- Title: Umbra Tech – Creator-led tools
- Description: Support innovation in open tech & indie software
- Keywords: donate indie tech, fund startup, sponsor tools
- OG & Twitter card data
- Image preview for social sharing

✅ Create `/fund-us.html` and `/press-kit.html`:
- Fund Us = mission, roadmap, donation goal, Stripe link
- Press Kit = logo download, founder quote, tagline, social links, donation impact

✅ Confirm mobile responsiveness
✅ Minify CSS and JS where possible
✅ Remove test code, console logs, placeholder text/images

---

🛡️ FUTURE-PROOFING:

✅ All logic should be modular, exportable, and reusable
✅ All sensitive values must use `.env`
✅ Error handling on all endpoints with logs + user-facing messages
✅ Add `lastUpdated` tag in backend to track code freshness
✅ Everything must survive 2027 without tech debt
